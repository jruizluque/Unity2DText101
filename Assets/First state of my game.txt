2. Pick up the gun with 8 bullets

Festers. Everywhere. Armed mostly with gas-powered rock flingers.
At least 10 of the guarding the hangar door. Typical.

Could try punching my way through. Or sneaking the long way to the emergency exit.

What should I do?
1. Take them head on - rush the 10 guards.
2. Sneak my way to the emergency exit.
